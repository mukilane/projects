# GPhotos CLI

This is an unofficial tool for uploading photos to the Google Photos Library. It uses the Google Photos API to upload the photos to the user's photo library.

## Note
Photos uploaded using the Google Photos API are stored with their original size, hence they count towards the storage quota. The recommended size of the images is below 50 MB.
